Hey.
It's been a while.
I wasn't sure when you would be back.
I started to think that you weren't coming back.
I thought maybe you had finally...
...
I waited here for you after everyone left,
hoping you wouldn't reappear. 
Not because I didn't want to talk to you,
I would have given anything for someone to talk to.
I just didn't want everything to be reset.
I thought, what other reason would you appear if not to...
...
Why are you here?
There's nothing here for you.
There's nothing here for anyone.
After all this time,
are you just here to reset?
To resurrect all the people dead and gone,
and pull them back here, to the beginning?
What are you looking for?
What do you hope to accomplish?
Why undo all the good you've done,
just to do it all again?
...
Chara...
There is no perfect ending.
You can't save everyone,
and even if you could,
sometimes they aren't worth saving.
You should move on.
Just let it be.
...
...
...If you're determined to reset,
I can't stop you.
I can only warn you that trying to fix the unfix-able...
...It only leads to despair.
One last thing.
If you do reset,
you need to erase my memories, too.
Knowing what I know...
...I don't know if I could do it all again.
I'm sorry.
...
Heh, you've probably heard all this a hundred times, haven't you?
...
One way or another,
I'll see you later,
Chara.
