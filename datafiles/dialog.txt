Hey..
normal
It's been a while.
normal
I wasn't sure when you would be back.
normal
I started to think that you weren't coming back.
relieved_looking_right_frown
I waited here for you here, after everyone left,
looking_right
hoping you wouldn't reappear. 
normal
Not because I didn't want to talk to you,
sad_smile
I would have given anything for someone to talk to.
relieved_looking_right
I just didn't want everything to be reset.
relieved1_frown
I thought, what other reason would you appear, if not for that.

Why are you here?
normal
There's nothing here for you.
normal
There's nothing here for anyone.
sad
After all this time,
normal
are you just here to reset?
relieved1_frown
To resurrect all the people dead and gone,
normal
and pull them back here, to the beginning?
sad
What are you looking for?
relieved2_frown
What do you hope to accomplish?
relieved2_frown
Why undo all the good you've done,
relieved2_frown
just to do it all again?

looking_right
There is no perfect ending.
sad
You can't save everyone,
relieved2
and even if you could,
relieved2
sometimes, they aren't worth saving.
relieved1
You should move on.
normal
Just let it be.

If you're determined to reset,
relieved2
I can't stop you.
normal
I can only warn you that trying to fix everything,
normal
that trying to make everyone happy,
sad
only leads to despair.

...
sad
One last thing.
normal
If you ignore my advice,
normal
If you do reset,
normal
you have to erase my memories, too.
relieved2
Having seen all this,
relieved_looking_right
knowing what I know,
relieved_looking_right_frown
I don't think I can do it all again.
relieved2_frown
I'm sorry.

sad
One way or another,
normal
I'll see you later,

Chara.
