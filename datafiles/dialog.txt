Hey.
normal
It's been a while.
normal
I wasn't sure when you would be back.
normal
I started to think that you weren't coming back.
normal
I thought maybe you had finally...
normal
...
normal
I waited here for you after everyone left,
normal
hoping you wouldn't reappear. 
normal
Not because I didn't want to talk to you,
normal
I would have given anything for someone to talk to.
normal
I just didn't want everything to be reset.
normal
I thought, what other reason would you appear if not to...
normal
...
normal
Why are you here?
normal
There's nothing here for you.
normal
There's nothing here for anyone.
normal
After all this time,
normal
are you just here to reset?
normal
To resurrect all the people dead and gone,
normal
and pull them back here, to the beginning?
normal
What are you looking for?
normal
What do you hope to accomplish?
normal
Why undo all the good you've done,
normal
just to do it all again?
normal
...
normal
Chara...
normal
There is no perfect ending.
normal
You can't save everyone,
normal
and even if you could,
normal
sometimes they aren't worth saving.
normal
You should move on.
normal
Just let it be.
normal
...
normal
...
normal
...If you're determined to reset,
normal
I can't stop you.
normal
I can only warn you that trying to fix the unfix-able...
normal
...It only leads to despair.
normal
One last thing.
normal
If you do reset,
normal
you need to erase my memories, too.
normal
Knowing what I know...
normal
...I don't know if I could do it all again.
normal
I'm sorry.
normal
...
normal
Heh, you've probably heard all this a hundred times, haven't you?
normal
...
normal
One way or another,
normal
I'll see you later,
normal
Chara.
